I worked in hospitality for nine years and entered a coding bootcamp, Wyncode, wanting to create a better future for my daughter and I.

Hispanic women are considered minorities in the tech field so I wanted to break these norms and create more possibilities for our future. Now as a Web Developer I've already shown my daughter you can do anything with persistence and hard work.

I strongly believe in using tech for good by implementing solutions to improve our society and environment in a positive direction.
